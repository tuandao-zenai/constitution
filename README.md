# The Nuance Constitution
In a world flooded with noise, Nuance exists to reward signal.

The Nuance constitution is the rules for how content should be judged in order to separate high quality nuanced information, from biased, polarizing and misleading information.

The validators on the Nuance subnet use AI that based on the prompts and rules in the constitution rates the posts on X made by miners, creating a transparent and trustless incentivze mechanism for nuanced public discourse.

Let’s set a new standard for online contribution.

Welcome to Nuance.
